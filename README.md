## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SQUADRON-LEADER/MUSIX.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory

   ```bash
   cd MUSIX
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser OR run a local server

   ```bash
   # using Node.js (if installed)
   npx http-server .
   ```

   This helps if you want to test audio playback reliably.

4. Make your changes (CSS / JS / images), then deploy (GitHub Pages, Vercel etc.)

## 🪄 How It Works (Core Logic)

* `script.js` handles loading audio files and controlling playback.
* UI updates in response to events (play / pause / ended / timeupdate etc.)
* CSS transitions / animations are used for smoother visual feedback
